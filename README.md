# Face recognition with Deepstream 6.0
This is a object detection and face recognition app build on Deepstream.

## Requirements
+ Deepstream 6.0+
+ GStreamer 1.14.5+
+ Cuda 11.4+
+ NVIDIA driver 470.63.01+
+ TensorRT 8+
+ Python 3.6+

Follow [deepstream](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_Quickstart.html#dgpu-setup-for-ubuntu) official doc to install dependencies.

Deepstream docker is more recommended.

## Pretrained
Please refer to links below for pretrained models and serialized TensorRT engine. Or download from [Google driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HTdIhGrKP7JnKY6n8F95mI7SBnx7-4R3).
+ [yolov5](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/master/yolov5)
+ [retinaface](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/master/retinaface)
+ [arcface](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/master/arcface)



## Usage

To preload the shared object libs, use `ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary`, please make sure the paths inside are correct.

Each model has a corresponding shared object file which is generated by TensorRTx. You can use your own if you follow the step Pretrained, or use the files in Google driver link above.
```
python3 main.py {URIPATH}
```
e.g.
```
python3 main.py file:///opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.0/sources/pythonapps/videos/samplevideo.h264
```
Notice that only support RTSP stream and Gstreamer format.

## Alignment
there should be a face alignment before arcface. Use a custom-gst-nvinfer to preprocess the tensor-meta of retinaface.

## Known issue
+ get a large amount of wrong outputs

    That's because of the [sychronazation bug](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/commit/e72d9db48ba8453fd4465048a0175621f1b1c501#diff-e4f7cf998c56a033573edc39c7736317f73a28402d835ee44001bac64f386dfb) of tensorrtx codes. To solve it you should modify the [decode.cu](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/blob/master/retinaface/decode.cu) file in tensorrtx repo and regenerate the engine.
+ ~~nvinfer procee-mode 2 freeze the pipeline:~~
  
  the bottleneck constraints of retinaface trt is about 160 fps while arcface is 30fps. should be careful.
